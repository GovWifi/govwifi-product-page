      <p>
        GovWifi allows government and public sector staff and visitors to connect
        to a single secure wifi service across multiple public sector locations
        through the same user login.

        Government and public sector guest wifi
      </h2>
      <p>
        Government and public sector organisations often have several different
        wifi networks across their various office locations. Each organisation
        often designs, procures, deploys and operates separate guest wifi networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        For staff and members of the public, visiting and working across these
        sites, this typically means managing multiple wifi username/password
        combinations for each site location.
      </p>
      <p>
        GovWifi allows staff and visitors to signup once and use the same user
        login to automatically connect to a single wifi service across multiple
        public sector locations.
