# Accessibility statement for GovWifi

This website is run by the Government Digital Service. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website aren’t fully accessible:

* our navigation is not always consistent across all of the GovWifi website. This might be confusing to some users as they're expecting a single product and a single website;
* some of our pages fail to use semantic markup to describe their content: headers are being used in place of list items, even if they are clearly labeled and numbered;
* some parts of our navigation is sticky (i.e doesn't move on scroll), which can leave very little screen estate for the actual content on mobile devices, depending on the orientation;
* we don't provide alternative ways to locate content, such as a search bar or a sitemap;
* our alternative texts for some images lack definition and should provide better information about them;
* Some of our page title don’t have their own descriptive titles.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

GDS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
Non accessible content
The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
Non compliance with the accessibility regulations

* Some pages have multiple H1 elements at the same level. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.3.1 (info and relationships).
* We sometimes have two images of the same thing - one for mobile and the other for desktop - we should have a single page for both. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.3.3 (sensory characteristics)
* The text alternative for some images is not descriptive enough, so the information in them is not sufficient to people using a screen reader. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content)
* The left navigation sometimes restricts view of half the page on a mobile device in portrait orientation. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.4 (orientation)
* The left navigation sometimes does not highlight where a user is on the page. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.7 (focus visible)
* Skip to main content skips to breadcrumb. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks)
* Navigation and accessing information
* It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.4 (orientation).
* It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.4 (resize text).
