# Accessibility statement for GovWifi
This service is run by the Government Digital Service (GDS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use it. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the service using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the service using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the service text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

# Technical information about this service’s accessibility
We're committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This service is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, because of the non-compliances listed below.

## Non accessible content

Some content on our [status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk/) is not compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard. The non-compliances are: 

* an incorrect heading hierarchy, which fails WCAG 2.1A 1.3.1 success criterion (Info and Relationships)

* missing level 1 headings, so users may not be able to accurately determine the structure of content on the page

* a missing main heading and an incorrect heading hierarchy on the status home page, which fails WCAG 2.1A 1.3.1 success criterion (Info and Relationships)

* the 'subscribe to updates' link does not contain programmatically discernible link text, which fails WCAG 2.1A 1.3.1 success criterion (Info and Relationships)

* the 'subscribe to updates' form fields do not contain an explicit label, which fails WCAG 2.1A 1.3.1 success criterion (Info and Relationships)

* the 'subscribe to updates' forms do not make it clear that they are expandable or collapsible, which fails WCAG 2.1A 4.1.2 success criterion (Name, Role, Value)

* the 'subscribe to updates' forms contain some text that does not meet the minimum colour contrast requirements, which fails WCAG 2.1AA 1.4.3 success criterion (Contrast (Minimum))

* the 'subscribe to updates' form close link ('x') is not descriptive enough for some users to work out its function or purpose, which fails WCAG 2.1A 2.4.4 success criterion (Link Purpose (In Context))

* the 'subscribe to updates' forms do not inform screen reader users of the error message that appears after incorrect data has been submitted, which fails WCAG 2.1AA 4.1.3 success criterion (Status Messages)

We plan to have these issues addressed by the current supplier, or move to an alternative supplier in 2021.

## How we tested this service
This service was last tested in September 2020. The test was carried out by GDS developers using a combination of automated and manual tests.

We tested the:

* [GovWifi information pages](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/), which give instructions for using GovWifi 
* [GovWifi admin platform](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in), where users manage their organisation's use of GovWifi 
* [status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk/), where users can see GovWifi incidents

We also have a separate [accessibility statement for the GovWifi technical documentation pages](https://docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/accessibility/#accessibility-statement-for-govwifi-technical-documentation).

When testing GovWifi, we:

* used 'Lighthouse' to audit each page for accessibility issues
* tested a sample of GovWifi product and documentation pages
* tested successful and unsuccessful user journeys

This statement was prepared on 11 September 2019. It was last updated on 30 October 2020.
