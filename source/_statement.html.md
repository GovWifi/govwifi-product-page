# Accessibility statement for GovWifi
This service is run by the Chief Digital Information Office (CDIO), part of Cabinet Office. We want as many people as possible to be able to use it. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the service using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the service using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the service text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is
We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

* the way that screen readers announce the different regions of our pages can be confusing

## What to do if you cannot access parts of this service
If you need information on this service in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille, contact [govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

We’ll consider your request and get back to you within 2 working days.

## Enforcement procedure
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).

## Technical information about this service’s accessibility
The CDIO is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This service is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, because of the non-compliances listed below.

## Non accessible content

### Status Page

Some content on our [status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk/) is not compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard. The non-compliances are: 

* Visual List: Some information and how items relate to each other are shown only visually and aren’t available as text for assistive technologies. This fails [success criterion 1.3.1: info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) (Level A)
* Tooltips: The tooltip feature on this page isn’t accessible for all users. It doesn’t work reliably with keyboard navigation, and some content appears only on hover or focus. This fails success criterion 
    * [2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html) (Level A).
    * [2.1.3 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html) (No Exception) (Level AAA)
    * [1.4.13: Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html)
* Resize Text: The text on this page cannot be enlarged to 200% without breaking the layout. This fails [success criterion 1.4.4: Resize text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html) (Level AA).
* No Headings: The page has no headings, which makes it hard to understand the page structure. This fails [success criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) (Level A).

## How we tested this service

The website was tested in July 2024 by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) using a combination of automated and manual tests, including:

* Technical auditing with automated accessibility tools to identify issues.
* Manual testing by analysts and testers with disabilities, using a range of assistive technologies (JAWS, NVDA, Dragon, TalkBack, VoiceOver, ZoomText) and keyboard-only testing.
* Testing covered desktop and mobile environments across multiple browser/OS combinations (Windows Chrome/Edge; iOS Safari; Android Chrome).
* Evaluations included diverse user needs (cognitive, low vision, screen reader users, etc.) 


DAC also tested to make sure that the service can be used:

* without a mouse
* by disabled people who do not use specific assistive technology

DAC tested the:

* [GovWifi information pages](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/), which give instructions for using GovWifi 
* [GovWifi admin platform](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in), where users manage their organisation's use of GovWifi 

In addition, GovWifi developers tested the [GovWifi status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk/), where users can see GovWifi incidents, in May 2024.

We have a separate [accessibility statement for the GovWifi technical documentation pages](https://docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/accessibility.html#accessibility-statement-for-govwifi-technical-documentation), which DAC also tested.


## What we're doing to improve accessibility

We have recorded and fixed previous issues including those highlighted by the DAC audit to the WCAG 2.1 AA standard.

We have plans to recommission an independent audit of our service at a future date.

This statement was prepared on 11 September 2019. It was last updated on 23 October 2025.
