# Accessibility statement for GovWifi
This website is run by the Government Digital Service (GDS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## What to do if you cannot access parts of this website
If you need information on this website in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille, contact [govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

We’ll consider your request and get back to you within 2 working days.

# Technical information about this website’s accessibility
GDS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non compliance with the accessibility regulations

The alternative text for some images is not descriptive enough, so the information in them is not sufficient for people using a screen reader. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).

Some pages have multiple H1 elements. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships).

There are sometimes 2 images used - one for mobile and another for desktop. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 1.3.3 (sensory characteristics).

The side navigation sometimes restricts the view of half of the page on a mobile device in portrait orientation. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 1.3.4 (orientation).

When a user chooses to skip to the page’s main content, sometimes the navigation only skips the top menu, not the side menu. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks).

The side navigation on the administrative platform sometimes does not accurately show where a user is on the website. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 2.4.7 (focus visible).

Some menu entries do not appear in an active state when a user browses their content. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 3.2.3 (consistent navigation).

We'll make all these elements fully accessible by 20 September 2020.

## How we tested this website
This website was last tested in September 2019. The test was carried out by GDS developers using a combination of automated and manual tests.

We tested:

* our main website platform, available at <https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/>
* our administrative platform, available at <https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in>
* our documentation pages, available at <https://docs.wifi.service.gov.uk>

When testing GovWifi, we:

* used Lighthouse to audit each page for accessibility issues
* tested a sample of GovWifi product and documentation pages
* tested successful and unsuccessful end user journeys

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility
We have recorded these issues in our backlog and will be handling them as part of our normal workflow. The website will be fully accessible by 20 September 2020.

This statement was prepared on 11 September 2019. It was last updated on 11 September 2019.
