people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that
means you should be able to:

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

# How we tested this website
This website was last tested in September 2019. The test was carried
out by GDS developers using a combination of automated and manual tests.

* we used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to audit each page for accessibility issues;
* we tested a sample of GovWifi product and documentation pages;
* we tested successful and unsuccessful end user journeys.

# What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We have recorded all of these issues in our backlog and will be
handling them as part of our normal workflow over the next quarters.

We have plans to commission an independent audit of our service at a
future date.
