        <p class="govuk-body">
          GovWifi is a cross-government service that provides wifi access in government
          buildings. It’s managed centrally by Government Digital Service (GDS), which
          is part of the Cabinet Office. It’s set up and supported by host organisations
          which provide the service to one or more government organisations.
