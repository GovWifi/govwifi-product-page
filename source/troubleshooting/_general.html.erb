<h3>Network problems</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
  If your device can connect to public wifi networks like coffee shop wifi, you should be able to connect to GovWifi.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  If you can’t see the GovWifi network in your wifi settings, you might be in a building that doesn’t have GovWifi. Look for GovWifi posters or contact the local IT team to check.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  You might be using a managed device if you can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    connect other devices to GovWifi but you can’t see the network on a specific device
  </li>
  <li>
    see the GovWifi network but your device tells you that you don’t have permission to connect
  </li>
  <li>
    If you think you are using a managed device, contact your local IT team. They’ll tell you if:
    <ul>
      <li>
        they can install a profile for GovWifi so that you can connect
      </li>
      <li>
        you’re using a secure government device that’s not allowed to connect to GovWifi
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
