        <p class="govuk-body">We have renewed the GovWifi certificate. Your device checks this certificate each time you connect to GovWifi to make sure it’s connecting to the genuine GovWifi network.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You might need to accept the new certificate on your device to continue using GovWifi.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you’re ever asked to accept a new certificate without being told in advance by the GovWifi team, do not accept it. Report it to the IT support desk for the building you’re in.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do depends on your device</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your device might automatically check the new certificate and accept it. In this case, you will not need to do anything.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Or, you may be asked to accept the new certificate.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If your device asks you to accept the new certificate</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you’re on a work device, contact the organisation that gave you the device as you may not have permission to accept the new certificate.</p>
