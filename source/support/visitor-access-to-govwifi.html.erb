          You will need a public sector staff member to sponsor your access to GovWifi.

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>send an email to <%= link_to "sponsor@wifi.service.gov.uk", "mailto:sponsor@wifi.service.gov.uk", class: "govuk-link" %></li>
          <li>leave the subject line blank</li>
          <li>only include the email address of each visitor on separate lines within the email</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Once this has been done, you will receive an email containing your GovWifi username and password.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you do not receive the username and password confirmation e-mail within a few minutes of signing up, please check your spam/junk e-mail folder.</p>
