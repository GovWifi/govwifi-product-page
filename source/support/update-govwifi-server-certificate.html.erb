        <p class="govuk-body">Every 2 years, GovWifi has to renew its server certificate to keep GovWifi as secure as possible.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">From the 11 November 2019, users on iOS, MacOS and Windows devices may receive a pop up message on their device asking them to accept the new certificate. Users will have to accept to continue using the GovWifi service. Android users should have the new certificate automatically accepted.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do to continue using GovWifi</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">To continue using GovWifi, you must switch to the new certificate when the message prompts you on your device. You must do this for all of your devices which use GovWifi.</p>
