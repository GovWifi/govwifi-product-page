        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Update the GovWifi server certificate</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">Every 2 years, GovWifi has to renew its server certificate to keep GovWifi as secure as
          possible.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">From the 11 November 2019, users on iOS, MacOS and Windows devices may receive a pop up
          message on their device asking them to accept the new certificate. Users will have to accept to continue using
          the GovWifi service. Android users should have the new certificate automatically accepted.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do to continue using GovWifi</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">To continue using GovWifi, you must switch to the new certificate when the message prompts
          you on your device. You must do this for all of your devices which use GovWifi.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Switching to the new certificate on your mobile</h3>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>If you receive the GovWifi pop up message on your mobile device, select Accept.</li>
          <li>Your device will automatically switch to the new certificate and reconnect to GovWifi.</li>
          <li>You can continue using GovWifi as normal.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Switching to the new certificate on your desktop or laptop</h3>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>If you receive the ‘Authenticating to network “GovWifi”’ pop up message on your desktop or laptop device,
            select Continue.
          </li>
          <li>Your device will automatically switch to the new certificate and reconnect to GovWifi.</li>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Troubleshoot</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">You are unable to connect to GovWifi</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you are unable to connect to GovWifi, try re-entering your GovWifi username and
          password. In some cases, you may also need to re-boot your device or rejoin your GovWifi network.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you are still experiencing problems, contact your IT support desk.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">You get an error that the Thumbprint/Fingerprint is incorrect</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">A Thumbprint (also sometimes referred to as a Fingerprint) is an ID that is uniquely
          calculated from a certificate. It is used to identify the certificate, as a validation check, or as a way to
          manage certificates in devices. Since a new certificate will have a different fingerprint, some users may
          get a confusing message that the Thumbprint/Fingerprint is incorrect.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you get this message, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>Validate the thumbprint for the new certificate matches one of (as of 11 November 2019):

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Accept the new certificate</li>
          <li>You can continue using GovWifi as normal</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">You don't have permissions to trust the GovWifi server certificate</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you are using a device managed by your organisation, you may have restricted
          permissions and may be unable to trust the new GovWifi certificate, the intermediate certificate, or the
          root certificate. Contact your IT support desk who should be able to accept them for you.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">In some cases, your IT support desk may need access to the new certificates. These can be
          downloaded here:</p>
