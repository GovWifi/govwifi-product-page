      <p>
        Participating government and public organisations keep their existing wifi infrastructure and configure it to access the GovWifi authentication service.
      </p>
      <h2>Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        GovWifi uses RADIUS server technology to authenticate users’ usernames and passwords.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each end user is protected with unique credentials and encryption keys when they log in to the wifi and access the internet.
        These credentials are randomly generated so can’t be used to get into other systems if stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users’ devices are isolated from each other to stop the horizontal spread of malware and protect secure devices from less secure ones.
        The network also identifies itself in a way that can’t be spoofed, adding to the safety measures that provide protection from potential attackers.
