      <p>
        GovWifi is a secure wifi service, developed by GDS. It provides wifi access in government buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
        GovWifi is currently in public beta, which means we’re still testing and improving it.
      </p>
      <p>
        GovWifi is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS) which is part of the Cabinet Office.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data controller for GDS is the Cabinet Office.
        They determine how and why personal data is processed.
        <%= link_to "Read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register", "https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053" %> for more information.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-data-we-need">What data we need</h2>
      <p>
        In order that GovWifi can work effectively for you we will need the following data:
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>email address OR mobile telephone number</li>
          <li>the number of authentication attempts you make</li>
          <li>activation and login dates</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also identify the buildings in which you access GovWifi.
      </p>
      <p>
        The legal reason we process this data is to let users in government, arm’s length bodies and public sector organisations stay connected to a secure wifi service while visiting other departments and moving between buildings.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="why-we-need-it">Why we need it</h2>
      <p>
        We need to know when you last used GovWifi so we can delete your account if it has not been used for 12 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to know your email address or mobile phone number so that we can notify you about major changes to the service or changes to the terms and conditions.
        For example, if the current inactive account deletion period of 12 months is reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        In accepting the terms and conditions of use you agree to the acceptable use policy of your host organisation.
        That organisation may restrict access for lawful purposes.
        We are obliged to be able to identify users who do not comply with these terms and conditions so access can be restricted/terminated.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-we-do-with-it">What we do with it</h2>
      <p>
        GDS will share this information with any host organisation from which you access the service if they request it.
      </p>
      <p>
        GDS may occasionally contact you by email or text message, using the information you’ve provided, to give you important information about the GovWifi service, including:
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>major changes to GovWifi, like restricting access to non-public sector workers</li>
          <li>changes to these terms and conditions</li>
          <li>requests for feedback to improve GovWifi</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not:
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
          <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We will share your data if we are required to by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.
